# Particle

**Particle Consitution** is a dummy constitutive model because there is no internal force in a particle. It's used to represent particle-like objects in a simulation.

## #13 Particle

Only influenced by external forces, such as gravity, contact or other constraints. 

Its deformation energy density is always zero:

$$
\Psi = 0
