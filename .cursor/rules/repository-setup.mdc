# Repository Setup for Forks

When working with a forked repository, GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands may fail to find issues and PRs because they default to the fork's repository instead of the upstream repository.

## Setup

Add the upstream repository as a remote (you can name it anything, `upstream` is conventional):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/spiriMirror/libuipc
```

## How Commands Work

All Cursor commands use `--repo spiriMirror/libuipc` to reference the upstream repository, ensuring they work correctly in:
- The upstream repository
- A forked repository  
- A repository with custom remote names

This ensures issues and PRs are always referenced from the upstream repository where they actually exist.
